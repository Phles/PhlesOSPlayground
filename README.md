PhlesOSPlayground is a makefile project to help programmers who want to get into OS development. While it is highly reccomended that you understand low-level programming and the underlying toolset for this project, the documentation is written to assume that you know nothing, because often times people understand one or more components of a feature in this process, but not all. That being said, there is not enough time to explain how every feature in this build system(or OS) works down to the hardware level, so there will be notes about what to look up to learn more about how particular systems interact with each other.
